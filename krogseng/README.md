# Project Title:
## Express Single Resource Exercise

#Synopsis: 
## Using Express and MongoDB, this application will write a single resource HTTP REST API.
* 'GET /resources' will list all of the resouces
* 'GET /resources/:id' returns a single resource with id = :id, responds with 404 if that id doesn't exist.
* 'POST /resources' will adds a new resource and returns the new entity from the database with id = _id.
* 'DELETE /resource/:id' deletes the resource with that id. Returns the count of resources deleted, 1 or 0.
* 'PUT /resource/:id' will update exisiting resource with matching id, or create new resource with given id.
